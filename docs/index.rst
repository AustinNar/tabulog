**tabulog** is standard template syntax for converting semi-structured log files (such as 'Apache' 
access.log files) into a tabular format, as well as a set of libraries (namely in R and Python) that 
implement the specification. **tabulog** is designed so that the template can be saved as a 
human-readable YAML file and ported from one language to another.
